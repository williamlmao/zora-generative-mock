# Dapp Starter Kit

This is a Next.js typescript template/starter kit that comes preloaded with all of the libraries I like to use in my projects. This repo handles a lot of the boilerplate setup for you.

# Libraries

- Tailwind & DaisyUI & Headless UI
- Wagmi
- Rainbowkit
- Framer Motion
- UI library
- React Icons
- Next SEO
- React-Query

### Why Headless UI AND Daisy UI?

Daisy is really great for themeing + some basic components, while Headless provides a lot of awesome features like keyboard accessibility to more complex components.

# What this starterkit handles for you

- Rainbow kit setup
- Tailwind darkmode setup
- Basic layout components (Header, footer, sidebar)
- Framer motion set up
- Sets up persistent layout patterns
- Adds additional folder structure. Lib, etc.
